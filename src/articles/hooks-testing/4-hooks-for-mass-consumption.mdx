The final category of hook usage is one of utility. These are hooks that are available in libraries or hooks and are used widely throughout your code. They often have a large API, so all of the functionality of a hook might not be used by a single component.

This is when we might consider testing a hook in isolation, which is especially important if the hook has a large API, meaning lots of parameters and/or return values. We want to do this because it might be hard to test all of the hooks functionality within a few component tests that use the hook, as they probably would not use all of the functionality that the hook can provide. This does not mean that we would avoid testing the components that use the hook too, this is also an important part to our code confidence.

<!-- does not mean not testing the components that use the hook too
 -->

Let's have another look at our hook and then figure out how to write tests for it in isolation:

<!-- TODO link to context testing chapter -->

One special consideration we need to make for this hook is the usage of Context. We will have to find a way to provide mocked Context in our tests similar to how we tested the consumer without a provider in the Context testing chapter.

To test our hook in isolation we are going to use [React Hooks Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library). It allows us to pass in a wrapper component that sets up the provider needed for Context.

First let's create a Setup Function so we can run our hook with different properties for each of the tests.

Then we can run the hook with the different parameters needed for each of our tests.

Writing tests like this where we test the hook in isolation makes our code more ridgid, usually functionality changes in the hook might mean that we will have to update the tests of the hook and tests of the components as well (if we are opting for integration tests in our components). But in the case of a hook within a library or widely used within an application, it's worth the trade off for high confidence that the hook will work as expected. Changes to the hooks API or replacing it with something else will usually require a large amount of refactoring anyway.
