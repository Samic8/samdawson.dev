A few months ago I added a feedback textbox to the bottom of every article. I wanted to know when finds there way to an article do they solve their problem.

I think the textbox was too much effort, who has the time to fill out feedback when they have a problem to solve. I didn't get any responses from this.

What they do have time for is low-quality feedback. Something that requires very little time on their part, but can provide me with some indication about their experience with the article.

A few weeks ago I added "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" buttons, and they have been getting clicks! It's low-quality feedback because I don't know why they clicked the button. But it's a helpful indicator of an article's helpfulness.

The data can guide my decisions on what article to update next based on this feedback.
