I haven't been making the time to learn. I feel like I used to be good at this. I would listen to programming podcasts, work on side projects and write about what I was learning on this blog.

I now have more responsibility at work than in the past and I've been using that to justify not exploring anything programming related in my own time.

I'm not sure of the right balance but I would like to again do more of these learning activities.
